## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### 1 — Data Cleaning in Excel

The raw CSV was cleaned and transformed in Microsoft Excel before loading into MySQL:

- **Removed duplicates** — identified and dropped duplicate Order IDs
- **Handled null values** — blank Amount and Qty fields filled or flagged
- **Standardised text columns** — trimmed whitespace in ship-city, ship-state, Category
- **Corrected data types** — Date column formatted to `DD-MM-YYYY`, Amount to number
- **Added helper column** — `Order_Month` extracted from Date using `=TEXT(A2,"MMM-YY")`
- **Filtered junk rows** — removed rows with invalid or missing Order IDs
- **Validated Status values** — standardised casing (e.g. "cancelled" → "Cancelled")

### 2 — Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL

```sql
-- Create and select the database
CREATE DATABASE amazon_db;
USE amazon_db;

-- Import via MySQL Workbench → Table Data Import Wizard
-- OR use LOAD DATA INFILE:
LOAD DATA INFILE 'AMZON_SALES.csv'
INTO TABLE amzon_sales
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

### 3 — Run the SQL analysis

Open `sql/USE_amazon_db_.sql` in MySQL Workbench and execute all 17 queries sequentially.
Results can be exported directly to Power BI via the MySQL connector.

### 4 — Open the Power BI dashboard

1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) (free)
2. Open `dashboard/amazon_sales_dashboard_New.pbix`
3. If prompted, reconnect the data source to your local MySQL instance

## 💡 Key Insights & Business Findings

### 1 — Revenue Decline
Revenue fell **18.8%** in just two months: April ₹2.70 Cr → May ₹2.45 Cr → June ₹2.19 Cr.
Requires investigation into seasonal demand and marketing effectiveness.

### 2 — High Cancellation Rate
At **13.32%**, the cancellation rate is well above the fashion e-commerce benchmark of 5–8%.
**Saree (14.69%), Kurta (14.66%), Set (14.60%)** are the highest-risk categories — likely driven by sizing issues or COD drop-offs.

### 3 — Geographic Concentration
**Maharashtra + Karnataka** account for **30.1% of total revenue**.
Top 5 cities by shipped orders: Bengaluru (7,262) › Hyderabad (5,271) › Mumbai (4,158) › Chennai (3,691) › New Delhi (3,660).

### 4 — Fulfilment Performance Gap
**Amazon-fulfilled** orders (65.1% of volume) generated **69.3% of revenue**, confirming higher basket sizes vs Merchant-fulfilled.
**Expedited shipping** dominates at 68.9% of orders and 69.2% of revenue.

### 5 — Category Strategy
**Set** was the #1 revenue category in all 3 months despite having fewer orders than Kurta — higher per-order value drives disproportionate revenue.

### 6 — Untapped B2B Segment
**B2B = only 0.62%** of orders (794 out of 128,975). Significant opportunity to grow bulk/reseller revenue with a dedicated B2B programme.
